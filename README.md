# VLOOKUP-Automation
VLOOKUP stands for ‘Vertical Lookup’. It is a function that makes Excel search for a certain value in a column (the so called ‘table array’), in order to return a value from a different column in the same row.
A VLOOKUP function exists of 4 components:

1. The value you want to look up;
2. The range in which you want to find the value and the return value;
3. The number of the column within your defined range, that contains the return value;
4. 0 or FALSE for an exact match with the value your are looking for; 1 or TRUE for an approximate match.

Syntax: VLOOKUP([value], [range], [column number], [false or true])

Thus, performing Vlookup in Excel takes the formula in particular pattern whereas, in python, program is written that involves formation of functions, and later those functions were called to perform Vlookup on two different files.
Similarly, vlookup automation here can be performed with different sheets in same csv or excel file.
